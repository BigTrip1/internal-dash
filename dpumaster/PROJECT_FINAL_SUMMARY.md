## **ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Deep Dive**

### **Intervention Tracking System** ðŸ†•
Revolutionary feature that transforms quality management:

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Click Any Trajectory Card** â†’ Opens intervention modal
2. **Add Improvement Plans** â†’ Document initiatives with impact estimates
3. **See Dual Forecasts** â†’ Compare baseline vs with interventions
4. **Track Progress** â†’ Monitor status and actual impact
5. **Build Knowledge** â†’ Learn what interventions work best

#### **Example Scenario:**
```
DPDI Stage (Deteriorating):
â”œâ”€ Current DPU: 11.09
â”œâ”€ Target: 1.80
â”œâ”€ Baseline Forecast: 12.64 DPU (deteriorating)
â””â”€ With Interventions:
   â”œâ”€ Operator Training: -2.0 DPU (High confidence, In Progress)
   â”œâ”€ New Jig: -1.5 DPU (Medium confidence, Planned)
   â”œâ”€ Process Improvement: -1.0 DPU (Medium confidence, Planned)
   â””â”€ Adjusted Forecast: 8.5 DPU (33% improvement!)
```

### **Smart Target Management**
Advanced target setting and allocation:

#### **Allocation Strategies:**
1. **Proportional:** Each stage's target proportional to current DPU contribution
2. **Fault-Weighted:** Weighted by fault volume for high-impact areas
3. **Hybrid:** Combination of proportional and fault-weighted approaches

#### **Features:**
- Year-specific targets (2025-2028)
- YTD context metrics
- Interactive tooltips
- Manual override capabilities
- MongoDB persistence

### **Three Totals Tracking**
Comprehensive metrics for different operational areas:

#### **Production Totals**
- Traditional production line metrics
- Build volume and fault tracking
- DPU calculations for production stages

#### **DPDI Totals**
- Dealer Pre-Delivery Inspection metrics
- Separate building mimicking dealership standards
- Additional quality data capture

#### **Combined Totals**
- Aggregated metrics across all areas
- Comprehensive quality overview
- Strategic planning foundation
